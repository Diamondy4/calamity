#+TITLE: Notes

* TODO Add 'Reason' request thing
I think a good way to do this is a wrapper request type that injects it
* TODO Webhook endpoints
* TODO Audit log model & endpoints
* DONE Things to test
CLOSED: [2019-04-27 Sat 16:25]
- Test using text-short and intern for certain strings
* DONE CANCELLED Shards need some way of making requests (get gateway, etc)
CLOSED: [2020-04-10 Fri 22:03]
- [X] Instead we just pass the gateway url to shards, it never changes, so w/e

* DONE Function to log out the bot, waiting for all stuff to end, etc

- we'll need some control messages that tell the client to enter a loop of
  waiting for all shards to signal that they are closed.

** Shard shutdown process?
- Send shutdown signal to shard
- Shard shuts down and sends a control message with it's own thread to the client stating that it is closed?
- Client removes shard from the set of shards
* DONE Move from lists of objects to maps of id => object

- linky :: https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#presence-update
* DONE Allow options for presences to be discarded
CLOSED: [2019-05-26 Sun 05:33]
- Pretty much nobody cares about presences on a bot but presences take up *a
  lot* of data (Turns out they don't lol)
* DONE Share user data
CLOSED: [2019-05-27 Mon 02:58]
instead of having a copy for each user object discord gives us.
This is probably a much better optimisation that discarding presences.
* DONE Migrate from Transformers and MTL to Free monads
CLOSED: [2020-04-10 Fri 22:02]
should be fun
* KILL Use barbies for data that updates (w/ magic defaulting stuff for aeson idk?)
