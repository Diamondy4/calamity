#+TITLE: Notes

* TODO Things to test
- Test using text-short and intern for certain strings
* TODO Shards need some way of making requests (get gateway, etc)
* TODO Function to log out the bot, waiting for all stuff to end, etc
- we'll need some control messages that tell the client to enter a loop of
  waiting for all shards to signal that they are closed.

** Shard shutdown process?
- Send shutdown signal to shard
- Shard shuts down and sends a control message with it's own thread to the client stating that it is closed?
- Client removes shard from the set of shards
